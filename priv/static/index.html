          <p>
            Tournamap.gg is a site for visualizing the location of offline video game tournaments. (Only Smash Ultimate is
            supported so far.) Each pin represents an upcoming tournament, click on it for details.

          <p>
            <s>I was bored idk</s>
            "Any tournaments happening near _____?" is a very common question in my community (NorCal). Some crazy
            individuals, in response, handmade and maintained a map showing where the locals are and when they happen. I
            thought that was awesome, and decided to try to automate something similar.

          <h2>Data Source(s)</h2>
          <p>
            Data is pulled from <a href="https://smash.gg/">smash.gg</a> roughly every half hour. We hope to eventually
            support other sources, such as challonge.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Make sure your tournament listing is publicly visible and discoverable. Someone should be able to find the page from the internet without being logged in.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If your tournament was recently published, try waiting an hour. The data is updated every half hour, but it may take some time for the updated data to become visible.
              </p>
